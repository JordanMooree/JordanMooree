I'm a recent graduate and aspiring software developer who is passionate about open-source contribution and who specializes in Frontend development using **HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**. I also work with **Java and Python**. 

I recently graduated (**cum laude**) from [Northeastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu/) with a Computer Science degree --- *Aug 2019 through May 2022*.

## School Engagement
- I've worked alongside student leaders of NEIU Computer Science club to help students engage in learning useful skills in workshops such as GitHub & Git, JavaScript, mock interview sessions, etc.

Take a look at the students and faculty involved in the club (prior to the pandemic, [link to website](https://neiu.acm.org/past-events/)):

## Here are some things I am currently working on:
1. Open Source contributions to projects making impact/improving people's lives
