I'm a software engineer who is passionate about open-source contribution and who specializes in Frontend development using **HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**. I am also knowledgeable of **SQL, Java, and Python**.

<br>Here are some projects I am currently working on:
1. Total reconstruction of my developer website (link coming soon)
2. Full-stack basketball application using NodeJS and ExpressJS
3. Multiple Python projects that use APIs to speed up workflow for many different use cases (e.g. Canva API to help speed up Graphic Designers workflow)
