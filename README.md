# Hi, I’m Jordan 👋🏽

I'm a backend developer @Amazon. I currently work with Java, Scala, and TypeScript along with a few of cloud services such as AWS Lambda and AWS Glue. I used to work more on the frontend prior to my current role but these past couple of months I've really enjoyed working with the backend. So I'm thinking maybe full-stack dev in the future? That'll be cool 😎

I recently graduated (**cum laude**) from [Northeastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu/) with a Computer Science degree before transitioning into this role.

## Here are some things I am currently working on:
1. Giving back to the people who helped me along my journey into tech
2. Rigorously learning how to write scalable, robust, and maintainable code 
3. (At some point) Creating lesson plans to distribute as free YouTube coding tutorials (focused in Python)
