I recently graduated (**cum laude**) from [Northeastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu/) with a Computer Science degree 

## Here are some things I am currently working on:
1. Open Source contributions to projects making impact/improving people's lives
2. Interview prepping 😎
3. Creating lesson plans to distribute as free YouTube coding tutorials (focused in Python)
